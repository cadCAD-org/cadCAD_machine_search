## Usage
### Tools

#### SCartesian product for parameter sweeping
### Visualizations

#### Sensitivity of control parameters to a given KPI

We recommend having a look on the notebooks/ folder, as we have a P&P model
that makes usage of the parameter sweep helpers together with the KPI sensitivity
visualization.
